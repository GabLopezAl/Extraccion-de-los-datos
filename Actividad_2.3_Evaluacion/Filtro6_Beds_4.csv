Hallo, ihr Lieben, 
da bin ich wieder. Vor Jahren habe ich schon ein paar mal Airbnb gemacht, gemietet, vermietet, besucht, und gereist .... Die meisten Erfahrungen mit Airbnb waren wirklich toll! Jetzt bin ich wieder da, als Gastgeberin und wir reisen derzeit weiter ... Wir - das sind meine siebenj√§hrige Tochter Rosaria und mein 14 Monate alter Sohn Josef. Wir lieben es, neue Menschen, fremde Kulturen und andere Sprachen kennen zu lernen. Wir sprechen Englisch und Spanisch. Ein ganz kleines bisschen Franz√∂sisch. Wir kommen aus Berlin, lieben unsere Stadt, Multi-kulti, Kunst und Kultur,
 aber wir m√∂gen auch ruhige Orte, Natur, Sonne und Strand, W√ºste, Regenwald, Berge, Vogelgezwitscher und Regenw√ºrmer.
Unsere eigene Wohnung zu Hause in Berlin haben wir mit viel Sorgfalt und Liebe hergerichtet, kindgerecht, familien und -besucherfreundlich. Wir gehen als G√§ste so mit unserer Unterkunft um, wie wir es uns auch von unseren eigenen G√§sten w√ºnschen: Hinterlassen es genauso sauber und unversehrt, wie wir sie vorgefunden haben - und wenn wir eine Spur hinterlassen, dann einen lieben Zettel an den Gastgeber mit unserem Namen, unsere Adresse und der Einladung, uns gerne auch einmal besuchen zu kommen. 
Wir freuen uns,  Euch kennen zu lernen!

Hallo, ihr Lieben, 
da bin ich wieder. Vor Jahren habe ich schon ein paar mal Airbnb gemacht, gemietet, vermietet, besucht, und gereist .... Die meisten Erfahrungen mit Airbnb waren wirklich toll! Jetzt bin ich wieder da, als Gastgeberin und wir reisen derzeit weiter ... Wir - das sind meine siebenj√§hrige Tochter Rosaria und mein 14 Monate alter Sohn Josef. Wir lieben es, neue Menschen, fremde Kulturen und andere Sprachen kennen zu lernen. Wir sprechen Englisch und Spanisch. Ein ganz kleines bisschen Franz√∂sisch. Wir kommen aus Berlin, lieben unsere Stadt, Multi-kulti, Kunst und Kultur,
 aber wir m√∂gen auch ruhige Orte, Natur, Sonne und Strand, W√ºste, Regenwald, Berge, Vogelgezwitscher und Regenw√ºrmer.
Unsere eigene Wohnung zu Hause in Berlin haben wir mit viel Sorgfalt und Liebe hergerichtet, kindgerecht, familien und -besucherfreundlich. Wir gehen als G√§ste so mit unserer Unterkunft um, wie wir es uns auch von unseren eigenen G√§sten w√ºnschen: Hinterlassen es genauso sauber und unversehrt, wie wir sie vorgefunden haben - und wenn wir eine Spur hinterlassen, dann einen lieben Zettel an den Gastgeber mit unserem Namen, unsere Adresse und der Einladung, uns gerne auch einmal besuchen zu kommen. 
Wir freuen uns,  Euch kennen zu lernen!

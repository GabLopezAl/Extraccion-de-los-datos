Elea: Ich bin 7 Jahre alt und gleichzeitig mit meinem Zwillingsbruder Ael zur Welt gekommen. Ich turne, habe einen unglaublichen Farbensinn und besuche die Waldorfschule.

Ael: Ich bin auch 7 Jahre alt. Unendlich neugierig auf die Welt. Ich interessiere mich von den kleinsten Tierchen bis zum Weltraumschiff f√ºr alles. Fussballspielen ist das genialste, aber in einen Verein trau ich mich noch nicht. Ich komme in die 2. Klasse der Waldorfschule.

Lived in Paris for 13 years. A few years ago, I discovered the possibilities of Berlin and especially our Prenzlauer Berg area.

In 2007 I started to decorate and to rent a few apartments in the building that my family and I are living in. 

In 2011 I opened my own caf√©, called caf√© KRONE. It is located in the same building and provides fine coffee and good food. 

All this would not be possible without the help of Sandra, who is working with me since a few years 

Thanks to Sandra, to my wife Steffi and the kids who are so patient with me.

By the way, I do not play guitar, but the photo looked cool and it gives me an artistic touch ;-)

Enjoy your retreat after an intensive day of visiting the metropolis.","The ground-level bungalow (one step 7,8 inch at the entrance) is in the rear of a 700 sqm plot of land surrounded by well-tended gardens. Grocery shops and a few Restaurants are within in walking distance (see my travel guide). From there you can reach Alexanderplatz in 35 minutes by public transport. The picturesque waterfront of the old town of K√∂penick is only a 15-minute trip away by bike and offers large selection of Restaurants and Bars. Two bicycles are at your disposal to ease your groceries in the vicinity, so that you can get around easily without a car. Enjoy the hideaway in a landscape protection area after a strenuous day visiting the metropolis. The Ulmen-playground just around the street corner offers fun for kids of all ages with climbing frames, swings, slides, a soccer field, table tennis, balancing course, picnic areas and benches. An evening walk on the nearby Wuhle hiking trail ensures relaxation; with a little luck you might even spot a beaver on the river bank.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-52213366/original/d590ce93-0194-4cd0-a915-fdf453f4975c.jpeg,422661817.0,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/422661817,Sonia,12/09/2021,,,within a few hours,100%,95%,t,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/03e34c80-26e6-4806-9308-04813ddb3ce0.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/03e34c80-26e6-4806-9308-04813ddb3ce0.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium,,1.0,1.0,"['email', 'phone']",t,t,"Berlin, Germany",Kaulsdorf,Marzahn - Hellersdorf,52.48855,13.56738,Entire bungalow,Entire home/apt,5.0,1.0,1 bath,2.0,4.0,"[""Baking sheet"", ""Dining table"", ""Crib"", ""Dedicated workspace"", ""Body soap"", ""Oven"", ""Bikes"", ""Outdoor shower"", ""Private patio or balcony"", ""Clothing storage: wardrobe and dresser"", ""Cooking basics"", ""Outdoor dining area"", ""Luggage dropoff allowed"", ""Cleaning products"", ""Iron"", ""Long term stays allowed"", ""Garden view"", ""Electric stove"", ""High chair"", ""Carbon monoxide alarm"", ""Hot water kettle"", ""First aid kit"", ""Pack \u2019n play/Travel crib - available upon request"", ""Outdoor furniture"", ""Free street parking"", ""Coffee"", ""Single level home"", ""Lockbox"", ""Laundromat nearby"", ""Drying rack for clothing"", ""Philips sound system with Bluetooth and aux"", ""Children\u2019s dinnerware"", ""Kitchen"", ""Freezer"", ""Sun loungers"", ""Bed linens"", ""Private backyard \u2013 Fully fenced"", ""Dishes and silverware"", ""Dishwasher"", ""Extra pillows and blankets"", ""Fire extinguisher"", ""Hair dryer"", ""Baby bath"", ""Hot water"", ""Smoke alarm"", ""Coffee maker: espresso machine"", ""EV charger"", ""Self check-in"", ""Toaster"", ""Board games"", ""Refrigerator"", ""Hangers"", ""Microwave"", ""50 inch HDTV with Netflix, premium cable"", ""Wine glasses"", ""Books and reading material"", ""Private entrance"", ""Changing table"", ""Room-darkening shades"", ""Central heating"", ""Wifi"", ""BBQ grill: charcoal"", ""Essentials""]",$135.00,3.0,1125.0,3.0,3.0,1125.0,1125.0,3.0,1125.0,,t,12.0,25.0,25.0,25.0,18/09/2024,63.0,21.0,2.0,20/12/2021,29/08/2024,4.89,4.87,4.83,4.95,4.95,4.67,4.76,10/Z/RA/004923-21,f,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,1.88

Da ich selbst gerne mit meiner Frau reise und wir viel unterwegs sind, finden wir es super spannend solche tollen Erlebnisse f√ºr andere bieten zu k√∂nnen. Wir sind vielleicht noch an vielen Dingen am Lernen und es mag nicht immer perfekt sein, aber f√ºr Feedback und Vorschl√§ge sind wir immer zu haben und teilen diese auf unseren Trips auch immer gerne :)

Meine Frau urspr√ºnglich aus Lettland und ich aus dem beschaulichen Brandenburg, leben wir jetzt gemeinsam in Berlin und finden die Orte um Berlin in Brandenburg super.

Da wir viel auch in der ganzen welt unterwegs sind, kann es nat√ºrlich auch mal sein dass ich nicht immer sofort dran bin wenn es doch mal etwas zum Austauschen gibt. Genau deswegen habe ich zum Gl√ºck ja alles super f√ºr dich/euch automatisiert, sodass du dich mega wohlf√ºhlen kannst und eine tolle Zeit hast.

Ansonsten sind wir gerne mit dem Rad unterwegs oder einfach sch√∂n entspannt zu Fu√ü Wandern in der Natur. 

F√ºr jegliche Anregungen und Feedback sind wir sehr offen und w√ºrden uns freuen mit euch in Kontakt zu treten, wenn wir helfen k√∂nnen. Oft vermutlich aus der Ferne, da wir ja selbst viel unterwegs sind.
